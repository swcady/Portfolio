# Portfolio
This is a rough draft and the start to my portfolio which I will display to potential employers.
Motiviation stemed fromt the photograph which was used from freeillustrated.com.
This project was built to display the new coding languages and programs that I learn throughout the bootcamp.
I used multiple lessons that we learned throughout the first 2 weeks including HTML code, CSS flexbox and dev tools.

I had help from my tutor Andrew Tirpok as well as the TA's during office hours.
I will continue to add to this page and upload additional images and examples of my work as I move throughout the course.
